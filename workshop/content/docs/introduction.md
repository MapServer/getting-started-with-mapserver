# Workshop Overview

This workshop is divided into 4 sections listed below.

1. **Introduction**. An introduction to MapServer and the software used for the workshop. This
includes Docker, OpenLayers, and Apache.

2. The **Mapfile**. A Mapfile is MapServer's configuration file. It points
to the data the Map will display, it defines how the data will be displayed,
and how the data will be served to client applications such as an Internet
browser. This first set of exercises will help to get familiar with the structure,
keywords, and syntax of a Mapfile. 

3. MapServer **Inputs**. These exercises show what type of data can be used as inputs into
MapServer. Both vector data and raster data are covered. 

4. MapServer **Outputs**. These exercises show how MapServer can publish data. When first
created MapServer was used to produce map images, but now it can serve data out in
a large number of open geospatial formats. Focus is given to [OGC](https://www.ogc.org/standards/)
standards as these are free, open and interoperable.

5. **Advanced** topics. These are a collection of miscellaneous exercises that cover
a wide range of MapServer functionality. Selected exercises will be chosen based on the
needs to the workshop participants. MapServer has over 25 years of development and 
features so new topics will be added over time.
