[MapServer](https://mapserver.org/) is an Open Source platform for publishing spatial data and interactive mapping applications to the web. 
Originally developed in the mid-1990â€™s at the University of Minnesota, MapServer is released under an MIT-style license, and runs on all 
major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X). 

**Getting Started with MapServer** is a half day workshop designed for users to become familiar with installing, configuring, 
and publishing data. This workshop will cover publishing geospatial data to the Web using MapServer in support of the suite of OGC API standards.

This workshop covers a wide range of topics (install/setup/configuration, publishing, cloud, templating, plugins, etc.). 
Please see the left hand navigation for the table of contents.
