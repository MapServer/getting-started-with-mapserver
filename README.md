# Getting Started with MapServer

Welcome to the Getting Started with MapServer workshop!

[MapServer](https://mapserver.org/) is an Open Source platform for publishing spatial data and interactive mapping applications to the web. 
Originally developed in the mid-1990’s at the University of Minnesota, MapServer is released under an MIT-style license, and runs on all 
major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X).

## For authors

Below are guidelines for authoring and/or improving the workshop's content.

### Setting up the MapServer environment

This workshop uses Docker (Docker, Docker Compose) to ensure a consistent environment
to deploy MapServer and work through the various exercises. As with participants, follow
the [Workshop environment setup](https://geographika.github.io/getting-started-with-mapserver/setup).

### Building the workshop content locally

The workshop manual is powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org) which facilitates easy management
of content and publishing. Workshop content is written in Markdown.


### Setting up the manual environment locally

```bash
# build a virtual Python environment in isolation
